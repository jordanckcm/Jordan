        I've been doing for our programming sub i'll be
        putting my logs and some other stuff here and keep  <br>
        everything clean cz why not

                <div class="aboutlogsmaincontainercontentupdatedescription">Products update - added some buttons for the shop
                    some more a's for the products and some hover animations. There is also a featured uhh <br> something something 
                    it's only for styles but ehh I'm gonna make it work in the future so stay tuned for that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Topbar - so the topbar has a working home products about etc, it also has a profile button now althought it's a 
                    fixed profile since idk how <br> to make working accounts yet, but when you click on it there's also a logout feature 
                    so that's pretty cool, it takes you back to the <br> index hehe I also added hover animations althought it's just an 
                    underline, it gives some pretty cool changes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What I will be working on next - Contacts I have to add like I mean I already have <br> the icons ready and they're also 
                    working buttons, so i'll just have to link them next and then that's br probably done, <br> for the Home tab i'll still have to think
                    about it so uhhh yes. Also the services it's empty rn so maybe in the future <br> once I get more ideas I'm also gonna have to polish
                    the contacts tab since it looks a lil messy n shi so yah, I might also add a working audio.

                <div class="aboutlogsmaincontainercontentupdatedescription">Home Update - I added a kind of example post but the code is not really loading so
                    i'll have to figure that out.
